# Facilities Feedback Reporter Tool

This tool provides an extremely simple user interface to make reporting issues
to facilities much easier, while at the same time, helps to reduce redundent
reports through the use of AI.

This tool is designed to integrate with the existing WSU facilities tracking
system behind the scenes.

This tool also provides historical reporting on problem areas that cost the
university more money in the over time.
